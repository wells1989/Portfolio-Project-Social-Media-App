## Personal Notes

This was a much more complex front-end than my previous projects, so for some of the feature I used some online tutorials to format the correct syntax

### Project Goals

- To get more comfortable with react components and both front and back end authentication
- To introduce more features than my last project, making the website more interactive with multiple pages etc
- To create more API calls from the front-end (likes / comments / searches etc)

### Successes

- The use of Redux store made the authentication process on the front end much more straight-forward and simple, and authentication took place both in the back and front end.

- The use of multiple reusable components / widgets made the multi-page structure much quicker and consistent.

- Other styling aspects (useTheme / light and dark modes / the user and post widgets with ternary statements based on mediaQueries) made the site much more visually appealing

### Areas to work on for next time

- Some aspects of the site were hardcoded (e.g. the advert Widget / the search term to determine the SearchPage.) Instead of this, I could have anticipated this and built the site in a more condusive way to conduct searches.
- The comments delete button didn't filter for user, due to the initial Schema of the post.comments array. Next time I will take more time in thinking about the final functionality when designing the API to ensure tweaks like this do not re-occur.
